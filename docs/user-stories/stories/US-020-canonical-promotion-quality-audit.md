# US-020 - Canonical Promotion and Quality Audit

## Epic

- EPIC-F Preparation Category Taxonomy and LLM Intake

## Story

As a content maintainer, I want approved staging items promoted with quality checks, so that canonical topics/questions stay clean and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Only approved staging records can be promoted to canonical tables.
2. Duplicate checks run before canonical insert/update.
3. Promotion writes an auditable operation record.
4. Post-promotion integrity report confirms topic-to-category ownership and expected multi-category question discoverability.

## Status

- Draft backlog (pre-implementation)
