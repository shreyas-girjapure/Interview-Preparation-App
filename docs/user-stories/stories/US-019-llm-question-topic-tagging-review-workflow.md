# US-019 - LLM Question Topic Tagging Review Workflow

## Epic

- EPIC-F Preparation Category Taxonomy and LLM Intake

## Story

As a content maintainer, I want question-topic mappings suggested by LLM to be reviewed before promotion, so that tagging quality remains reliable at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Question-topic suggestions are generated only against approved topics.
2. Suggestions are stored with confidence and model metadata.
3. Human review decisions are required before canonical write.
4. Rejected suggestions retain reason codes for prompt/process tuning.

## Status

- Draft backlog (pre-implementation)
