# US-012 - CSV Bulk Import Workflow

## Epic

- EPIC-E Content Operations v2

## Story

As a content maintainer, I want a repeatable Supabase CSV import workflow for topics/questions/answers, so that I can update large datasets quickly without building an in-app importer.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bulk updates are executed through Supabase dashboard CSV importer.
2. Import key strategy is documented (for example: slug or external ID handling).
3. Import checklist documents validation and rollback steps.

## Status

- Backlog (Phase 6 / v2)
