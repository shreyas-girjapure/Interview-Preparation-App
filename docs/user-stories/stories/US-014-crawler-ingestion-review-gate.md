# US-014 - Crawler Ingestion With Review Gate

## Epic

- EPIC-E Content Operations v2

## Story

As a content maintainer, I want crawler-discovered items to require review, so that low-quality content is not auto-published.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Crawler output lands in moderation queue.
2. Items remain unpublished until approved.
3. Source metadata is stored for traceability.

## Status

- Backlog (Phase 6 / v2)
