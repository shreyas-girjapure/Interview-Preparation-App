# US-018 - LLM Topic Candidate Review Workflow

## Epic

- EPIC-F Preparation Category Taxonomy and LLM Intake

## Story

As a content maintainer, I want LLM-generated topic candidates to go through review, so that only high-quality topics are promoted to canonical taxonomy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Raw imported question text can be grouped into ingestion batches.
2. LLM topic candidates are stored with confidence and source metadata.
3. Human review decisions (approve/reject) are recorded and auditable.
4. Only approved topic candidates are eligible for canonical promotion.

## Status

- Draft backlog (pre-implementation)
