# EPIC-D - Admin Content Management

## Goal

Enable admins and editors to manage topics, relationships, and publish flow safely.

## Status

- Archived (not planned for v1)

## Replacement Strategy

- Manage content directly via Supabase dashboard, SQL editor, and CSV importer workflows.

## In Scope

- Topic CRUD
- Topic relationship management
- Draft, review, and publish workflow

## Stories

- US-009 Manage Topics (`docs/user-stories/stories/US-009-manage-topics.md`)
- US-010 Manage Topic Relationships (`docs/user-stories/stories/US-010-manage-topic-relationships.md`)
- US-011 Publish Workflow (`docs/user-stories/stories/US-011-publish-workflow.md`)

## Epic Exit Criteria

- Admin users can maintain content lifecycle with role-appropriate access controls.
